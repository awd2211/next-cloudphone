## Technical Implementation Details

### Mock Setup Complexity

**PaymentsService**:
- 8 providers/services mocked (repositories, payment providers, balance client, saga orchestrator)
- Complex transaction mocking with QueryRunner
- Saga step verification (4-step refund workflow)

**InvoicesService**:
- QueryBuilder mocking for complex queries
- Invoice calculation methods (calculateTotal, canCancel, isOverdue)
- Date-based filtering and overdue detection

**MeteringService**:
- HTTP client mocking for external service calls
- PricingEngineService integration
- Multiple stat types (user, device, tenant)
- Time-based calculations

### Testing Patterns Used

1. **Comprehensive Error Scenarios**: All services test both success and failure paths
2. **Integration Points**: Tested external service interactions (HTTP, Saga, Pricing)
3. **Business Logic Validation**: Verified status transitions, calculations, and constraints
4. **Scheduled Task Testing**: Verified cron job behaviors
5. **Multi-provider Support**: Tested different payment methods and device providers

## Challenges Solved

### PaymentsService Issues (3 failures fixed)

1. **Order Status in Balance Tests**: Mock order retained PAID status from previous tests. Fixed by explicitly setting `status: PENDING`.

2. **Saga Method Name**: Initial mock used `execute` but service uses `executeSaga`. Fixed by renaming mock method.

3. **Error Exception Types**: Balance errors are caught and re-thrown as `InternalServerErrorException`. Updated tests to expect correct type.

4. **Saga Step Count**: Expected 3 but actual has 4 steps. Updated to verify all step names.

### InvoicesService Success

All 14 tests passed on first run - clean implementation with proper TypeORM patterns.

### MeteringService Success

All 12 tests passed on first run - proper HTTP client mocking and pricing engine integration.

## Architecture Highlights

### Payment Processing Flow

```
User initiates payment
    ↓
PaymentsService.createPayment()
    ↓
Validate order (exists, PENDING, amount match)
    ↓
Create payment record
    ↓
initiatePayment() → Provider/Balance
    ↓
Update payment status (PROCESSING/SUCCESS/FAILED)
    ↓
If SUCCESS → Update order to PAID
```

### Invoice Lifecycle

```
DRAFT → publish() → PENDING
            ↓
        payInvoice()
            ↓
          PAID
            ↓
    (or) OVERDUE (auto-detect)
    (or) CANCELLED (user request)
```

### Metering Flow

```
Device starts → startUsageTracking()
    ↓
Hourly collection → collectDeviceUsage()
    ↓
Save with pricing → PricingEngine.calculateCost()
    ↓
Device stops → stopUsageTracking()
    ↓
Final cost calculation
```

## Integration Points Tested

1. **PaymentsService**:
   - BalanceClientService (balance payment)
   - SagaOrchestratorService (refund workflow)
   - Payment providers (WeChat, Alipay, Stripe, etc.)
   - OrdersRepository (order status updates)

2. **InvoicesService**:
   - UsageRecords (implicit - for invoice generation)
   - Scheduled tasks (monthly invoice generation, overdue detection)

3. **MeteringService**:
   - HttpClientService (Device Service API calls)
   - PricingEngineService (cost calculation)
   - Event-driven tracking (device start/stop events)

## Next Steps

### Optional: Additional Testing (Not Required for P2)

If extended testing is needed in the future:

1. **BalanceService** (~5-8 tests) - Currently not tested but lower priority
   - Balance queries
   - Recharge processing
   - Transaction history
   - Balance alerts

2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end flows
   - Full payment → invoice → metering cycle
   - Refund workflow with order updates
   - Multi-tenant scenarios

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Large-scale usage collection
   - Invoice generation for many users
   - Statistics aggregation performance

### Immediate Actions

✅ All P2 high-priority Billing Service tests completed
✅ Ready to proceed to next service or phase
✅ Consider running full test suite to verify no regressions
