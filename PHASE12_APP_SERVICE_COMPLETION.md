## Technical Implementation Details

### Mock Setup Complexity

**MinioService**:
- Mocked MinIO.Client constructor
- Mocked fs module for file operations
- Stream handling for file listing

**ApkParserService**:
- Mocked app-info-parser library
- Complex mock setup for constructor-based library
- File system mocking for icon extraction

**AppsService**:
- Extended existing comprehensive test suite
- Added audit record filtering tests
- Query builder mocking for complex filters

### Testing Patterns Used

1. **Library Constructor Mocking**: Successfully mocked app-info-parser constructor
2. **Stream Testing**: Tested MinIO stream-based file listing with event emitters
3. **File Size Formatting**: Tested human-readable size conversion (B/KB/MB/GB)
4. **Error Resilience**: All services tested for error scenarios
5. **Presigned URL Testing**: Mocked presignedGetObject for secure file access

## Challenges Solved

### ApkParserService Mock Issue

**Problem**: app-info-parser is a constructor-based library, difficult to mock

**Solution**:
```typescript
const mockParse = jest.fn();
jest.mock('app-info-parser', () => {
  return {
    AppInfoParser: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
      parse: mockParse,
    })),
  };
});
```

### MinIO Stream Testing

**Problem**: MinIO's listObjects returns an event-based stream

**Solution**: Mocked stream with event emitters:
```typescript
const mockStream = {
  on: jest.fn((event, handler) => {
    if (event === 'data') {
      mockFiles.forEach((file) => handler(file));
    } else if (event === 'end') {
      setTimeout(() => handler(), 0);
    }
    return mockStream;
  }),
};
```

### File Size Validation Test

**Problem**: validateApk catches exceptions and returns false instead of throwing

**Solution**: Changed test expectation from `rejects.toThrow` to `expect(result).toBe(false)`

## Architecture Highlights

### APK Upload Flow

```
User uploads APK
    ↓
AppsService.uploadApp()
    ↓
1. Upload file to MinIO
2. Parse APK with ApkParserService
3. Extract metadata (package, version, permissions)
4. Create app record in database
5. Execute Saga for orchestration
    ↓
App status: UPLOADING → PENDING_REVIEW → AVAILABLE
```

### App Review Workflow

```
UPLOADING (initial upload)
    ↓
PENDING_REVIEW (submitForReview)
    ↓
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
↓             ↓             ↓
AVAILABLE   REJECTED   CHANGES_REQUESTED
(approved)  (rejected)  (requestChanges)
```

### MinIO Integration

```
AppsService → MinioService → MinIO Server
    ↓              ↓              ↓
Upload APK    putObject      Store file
Download APK  presignedUrl   Generate secure URL
Delete APK    removeObject   Delete file
```
