# Phase 6: Business Logic Services Testing - Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Phase:** Phase 6 - Business Logic Services Testing
**Status:** In Progress (P0 Services Reviewed)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 6 focuses on testing critical business logic services. Initial assessment shows that many high-priority service tests already exist with good coverage. Out of 3 P0 services reviewed:

- ✅ **UsersService**: 40 tests, 100% passing
- ⚠️ **DevicesService**: 22 tests exist but all failing (setup issue)
- ✅ **AuthService**: 36 tests, 25 passing, 11 skipped

---

## P0 Services Status

### 1. ✅ UsersService (COMPLETE)

**Location:** `backend/user-service/src/users/users.service.spec.ts`
**Test Count:** 40 tests
**Pass Rate:** 100% (40/40)

**Test Coverage:**
- User creation with parallel duplicate checking
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role assignment (default + custom roles)
- Event publishing (created, updated, deleted, password_changed, account_locked)
- Two-level caching (L1 + L2 Redis)
- Login attempt tracking with progressive locking:
  - 3 failures → 5 minute lock
  - 5 failures → 15 minute lock
  - 10 failures → 24 hour lock
- Account lock expiration and reset
- Statistics calculation with cache
- Multi-tenant filtering
- Pagination
- Soft delete
- Update operations with email duplicate checking

**Key Test Patterns:**
```typescript
// Parallel duplicate checking (performance optimization)
it('should use parallel queries to check duplicates', async () => {
  // Arrange
  usersRepository.findOne
    .mockResolvedValueOnce(null) // username check
    .mockResolvedValueOnce(null); // email check

  // Assert - both checks run in parallel
  expect(usersRepository.findOne).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
});

// Progressive account locking
it('should lock account for 5 minutes after 3 failed attempts', async () => {
  const user = { loginAttempts: 2 } as User;

  await service.incrementLoginAttempts('user-123');

  expect(user.loginAttempts).toBe(3);
  expect(eventBus.publish).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    'events',
    'user.account_locked',
    expect.objectContaining({ attempts: 3, severity: 'warning' }),
  );
});
```

**Business Value:**
- Prevents concurrent registration race conditions
- Protects against brute force attacks
- Maintains data integrity with ACID transactions
- Optimizes read performance with caching
- Tracks security events for audit

### 2. ⚠️ DevicesService (NEEDS FIX)

**Location:** `backend/device-service/src/devices/__tests__/devices.service.spec.ts`
**Test Count:** 22 tests
**Pass Rate:** 0% (0/22) - All tests failing on setup

**Issue:** Missing `DeviceProviderFactory` mock in test setup.

**Error:**
```
Nest can't resolve dependencies of the DevicesService (DeviceRepository, ?, ...).
Please make sure that the argument DeviceProviderFactory at index [1] is available.
```

**Root Cause:**
The service constructor requires `DeviceProviderFactory` but the test module doesn't provide a mock for it. The existing tests were written before the provider factory was added.

**Attempted Tests Coverage:**
- Device creation with Saga pattern (5-step orchestration)
- Port allocation (Redroid)
- Provider device creation (multi-provider support)
- Database record creation with transactional outbox
- Quota usage reporting
- Device start/stop/restart operations
- Health checks
- ADB operations (shell commands, screenshot, APK install/uninstall)
- Metrics collection
- Cache management

**Complexity:**
- Service has 1835 lines
- Uses Saga orchestration with compensation
- Supports multiple device providers (Redroid, Physical, AWS, Azure)
- Complex async workflows
- Transaction management with QueryRunner
- Event Sourcing integration

**Fix Required:**
Add `DeviceProviderFactory` mock to test setup:
```typescript
{
  provide: DeviceProviderFactory,
  useValue: {
    getProvider: jest.fn(() => mockProvider),
  },
}
```

### 3. ✅ AuthService (MOSTLY COMPLETE)

**Location:** `backend/user-service/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts`
**Test Count:** 36 tests (25 passing, 11 skipped)
**Pass Rate:** 69% (25/36)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ CAPTCHA generation
- ✅ User registration with duplicate checks
- ✅ Password hashing
- ⏭️ Login flow (core tests skipped)
- ✅ Logout and token blacklisting
- ✅ Token expiration checking
- ✅ Profile retrieval with role loading
- ✅ Token refresh
- ✅ User validation
- ✅ Password hashing security

**Skipped Tests (11):**
- Login success with JWT generation
- Password verification and failure tracking
- Account locking on 5 failures
- Locked account login rejection
- Non-active account rejection
- Login success counter reset
- Pessimistic locking for concurrency
- Transaction rollback testing
- JWT payload role/permission inclusion
- Development mode captcha skip

**Why Tests Are Skipped:**
The skipped tests likely involve database transactions and complex async flows that require additional setup (QueryRunner, transaction management, pessimistic locking).

**Key Test Example:**
```typescript
it('should successfully logout and blacklist token', async () => {
  const mockUser = { id: 'user-123', username: 'testuser' };
  const mockToken = 'valid.jwt.token';

  jwtService.decode.mockReturnValue({
    exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600
  });
  redisService.set.mockResolvedValue('OK');

  await service.logout(mockUser, mockToken);

  expect(redisService.set).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    'token:blacklist:valid.jwt.token',
    'true',
    'EX',
    expect.any(Number),
  );
});
```

## Test Statistics Summary

| Service | Tests | Passing | Failing | Skipped | Pass Rate |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| UsersService | 40 | 40 | 0 | 0 | 100% |
| DevicesService | 22 | 0 | 22 | 0 | 0% (setup issue) |
| AuthService | 36 | 25 | 0 | 11 | 69% |
| **Total** | **98** | **65** | **22** | **11** | **66%** |

## Technical Patterns Observed

### 1. Mock Factory Pattern
```typescript
const createMockRepository = () => ({
  find: jest.fn(),
  findOne: jest.fn(),
  save: jest.fn(),
  create: jest.fn(),
});
```

### 2. Async Mock Implementation
```typescript
mockQueryBuilder.getMany.mockImplementation(async () => {
  // Simulate async DB query
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve([]), 100));
});
```

### 3. Parallel Execution Testing
```typescript
it('should execute duplicate checks in parallel', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  await service.create(dto);
  const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;

  expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(150); // ~100ms for parallel vs ~200ms sequential
});
```

### 4. Event Publishing Verification
```typescript
expect(eventBus.publishUserEvent).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  'created',
  expect.objectContaining({
    userId: expect.any(String),
    username: dto.username,
  }),
);
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: DeviceProviderFactory Dependency
**Problem:** Service constructor signature changed but tests weren't updated.
**Solution:** Add factory mock to test module providers.
**Impact:** Blocks all 22 DevicesService tests.

### Challenge 2: Skipped Login Tests
**Problem:** Complex transaction management and pessimistic locking hard to mock.
**Solution:** Requires QueryRunner mocking with transaction lifecycle.
**Impact:** 11 tests skipped, core authentication flow untested.

### Challenge 3: Service Complexity
**Problem:** DevicesService has 1835 lines with Saga orchestration.
**Solution:** Focus tests on public API, mock internal service calls.
**Impact:** High test maintenance burden.

2. **Enable AuthService Login Tests** - Add transaction mocks (1 hour)
3. **Review AppsService** - Check if tests exist (15 minutes)
4. **Review BillingService** - Check if tests exist (15 minutes)
5. **Create Phase 6 Completion Report** - After all P0 services tested

---

## Conclusion

Phase 6 initial review reveals good test coverage for UsersService (100%) and partial coverage for AuthService (69%). DevicesService tests exist but are blocked by a setup issue. Once the DevicesService issue is resolved, Phase 6 P0 services will have approximately 87 tests covering critical business logic.

**Estimated Completion:**
- Fix DevicesService: 30 minutes
- Enable AuthService skipped tests: 1 hour
- **Total remaining work: 1.5 hours** for P0 services

**Current Status:** 65/98 tests passing (66%)
**Target Status:** 98/98 tests passing (100%) for P0 services
