---

## Work Completed

### 1. ✅ DevicesService Complete Fix (18% → 100%)

**Phase 1: Setup Fix (0% → 18%)**

**Problem:** All 22 tests failing with dependency resolution error:
```
Nest can't resolve dependencies of the DevicesService (DeviceRepository, ?, ...).
Please make sure that the argument DeviceProviderFactory at index [1] is available.
```

**Root Cause:** Service constructor was refactored to use Saga pattern with new dependencies, but tests weren't updated.

**Solution Implemented:** Added 6 missing mock dependencies:

```typescript
// Added imports
import { DataSource } from "typeorm";
import { ModuleRef } from "@nestjs/core";
import { EventOutboxService, SagaOrchestratorService } from "@cloudphone/shared";
import { CacheService } from "../../cache/cache.service";
import { DeviceProviderFactory } from "../../providers/device-provider.factory";

// Added mocks
const mockProviderFactory = {
  getProvider: jest.fn(() => mockProvider),
};

const mockCacheService = {
  get: jest.fn(),
  set: jest.fn(),
  del: jest.fn(),
  wrap: jest.fn(),
};

const mockEventOutboxService = {
  writeEvent: jest.fn(),
};

const mockSagaOrchestrator = {
  executeSaga: jest.fn(),
  getSagaStatus: jest.fn(),
  compensateSaga: jest.fn(),
};

const mockModuleRef = {
  get: jest.fn(),
};

const mockDataSource = {
  createQueryRunner: jest.fn(() => mockQueryRunner),
};

// Added to test module providers
{
  provide: DeviceProviderFactory,
  useValue: mockProviderFactory,
},
{
  provide: CacheService,
  useValue: mockCacheService,
},
{
  provide: EventOutboxService,
  useValue: mockEventOutboxService,
},
{
  provide: ModuleRef,
  useValue: mockModuleRef,
},
{
  provide: SagaOrchestratorService,
  useValue: mockSagaOrchestrator,
},
{
  provide: DataSource,
  useValue: mockDataSource,
},
```

**Result:** Tests can now compile and run. 4/22 tests passing (18%).

---

**Phase 2: Full Test Update (18% → 100%)** ✅

**Completed:** All 18 failing tests fixed through systematic updates.

**Key Changes:**
1. **Adapted create() tests to Saga pattern** (5 tests)
   - Mock SagaOrchestrator.executeSaga() instead of direct operations
   - Verify 5-step orchestration (ALLOCATE_PORTS → CREATE_PROVIDER_DEVICE → CREATE_DATABASE_RECORD → REPORT_QUOTA_USAGE → START_DEVICE)
   - Handle async device creation with placeholder returns

2. **Updated event assertions to Outbox pattern** (5 tests in remove/start/stop)
   - Changed from `mockEventBus.publishDeviceEvent()` to `mockEventOutboxService.writeEvent()`
   - Verify transactional event publishing with QueryRunner

3. **Fixed cache mock** (3 tests)
   - Added `cache.wrap()` implementation
   - Added `cache.delPattern()` for cache invalidation

4. **Added providerType to all mock devices** (10+ tests)
   - All Device mocks now include required `providerType` field

5. **Updated test expectations** (2 tests)
   - Changed from "throw BadRequestException" to "skip provider operations" when externalId is null

6. **Fixed ADB disconnect logic** (1 test)
   - Added `adbPort` field to trigger ADB disconnection in stop() tests

**Final Result:** 22/22 tests passing (100%) ✅

## Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Dependency Injection Fixes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Test failed to compile - missing providers
const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
  providers: [
    DevicesService,
    { provide: getRepositoryToken(Device), useValue: mockRepository },
    { provide: DockerService, useValue: mockDocker },
    // ❌ Missing: DeviceProviderFactory, CacheService, etc.
  ],
}).compile();
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Test compiles and runs - all dependencies provided
const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
  providers: [
    DevicesService,
    { provide: getRepositoryToken(Device), useValue: mockRepository },
    { provide: DockerService, useValue: mockDocker },
    // ✅ Added all 6 missing dependencies
    { provide: DeviceProviderFactory, useValue: mockProviderFactory },
    { provide: CacheService, useValue: mockCacheService },
    { provide: EventOutboxService, useValue: mockEventOutboxService },
    { provide: ModuleRef, useValue: mockModuleRef },
    { provide: SagaOrchestratorService, useValue: mockSagaOrchestrator },
    { provide: DataSource, useValue: mockDataSource },
  ],
}).compile();
```

### 2. Mock Patterns Established

**Provider Factory Pattern:**
```typescript
const mockProvider = {
  create: jest.fn(),
  start: jest.fn(),
  stop: jest.fn(),
  destroy: jest.fn(),
  getStatus: jest.fn(),
  getMetrics: jest.fn(),
};

const mockProviderFactory = {
  getProvider: jest.fn(() => mockProvider),
};
```

**QueryRunner Pattern:**
```typescript
const mockQueryRunner = {
  connect: jest.fn(),
  startTransaction: jest.fn(),
  commitTransaction: jest.fn(),
  rollbackTransaction: jest.fn(),
  release: jest.fn(),
  manager: {
    getRepository: jest.fn(() => mockDeviceRepository),
  },
};

const mockDataSource = {
  createQueryRunner: jest.fn(() => mockQueryRunner),
};
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Keep Tests in Sync with Refactoring

**Problem:** Service was refactored to use Saga pattern months ago, but tests weren't updated.

**Impact:** All 22 tests blocked, appeared broken to developers.

**Solution:**
- Add pre-commit hook to run tests
- Require tests to pass before allowing refactoring PRs
- Update tests in same PR as implementation changes

### 2. Document Breaking Changes

**Problem:** No documentation about Saga refactor, new dependencies not listed.

**Impact:** 1 hour spent diagnosing missing dependencies.

**Solution:**
- Add CHANGELOG.md entry for breaking changes
- Update test examples in README
- Include migration guide for test updates

### 3. Mock Complexity Increases with Saga

**Problem:** Saga pattern adds orchestration layer, increasing mock complexity.

**Impact:** Tests harder to write and maintain.

**Solution:**
- Create test helper: `mockSagaExecution(saga, finalState)`
- Provide example tests in docs
- Consider integration tests for Saga flows

### 4. Test Data Must Match Reality

**Problem:** Mock devices missing new required fields (`providerType`).

**Impact:** 13 tests fail with `Cannot read properties of undefined`.

**Solution:**
- Create factory functions: `createMockDevice(overrides)`
- Keep mock data in sync with entity definitions
- Use TypeScript to catch missing fields

---
