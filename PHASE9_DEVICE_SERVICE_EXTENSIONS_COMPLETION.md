- ✅ Proper cleanup in afterEach hooks
- ✅ Descriptive test names following "should..." convention
- ✅ Comprehensive assertions (expect.toHaveBeenCalled, expect.toContain, etc.)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance

---

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Timer Issues in LifecycleService

**Challenge:** `attemptRecovery()` method had a 5-second `setTimeout` delay causing tests to timeout.

**Solution:**
```typescript
jest.useFakeTimers();
const cleanupPromise = service.cleanupErrorDevices();
await jest.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(5000);
const result = await cleanupPromise;
jest.useRealTimers(); // Reset in afterEach
```

### 2. Mock Cascading in Error Paths

**Challenge:** Error handling tests were not properly failing because mocks weren't set up to cascade errors correctly.

**Solution:**
```typescript
dockerService.stopContainer.mockRejectedValue(new Error("Docker error"));
adbService.disconnectFromDevice.mockResolvedValue(undefined);
deviceRepository.save.mockRejectedValue(new Error("Save failed"));
// Ensures error propagates through the entire chain
```

### 3. Prometheus Metrics Validation

**Challenge:** Difficult to directly assert on Prometheus metric values.

**Solution:** Used `service.getMetrics()` to retrieve Prometheus text format and validated with `toContain`:
```typescript
const metrics = await service.getMetrics();
expect(metrics).toContain("cloudphone_device_cpu_usage_percent");
expect(metrics).toContain('tenant_id="tenant-1"');
```

### 4. Transaction Mocking for Rollback

**Challenge:** TypeORM transactions are complex to mock.

**Solution:** Created mock entity manager that returns the repository:
```typescript
const mockEntityManager = {
  getRepository: jest.fn(() => mockDeviceRepository),
};
dataSource.transaction.mockImplementation((callback) =>
  callback(mockEntityManager)
);
```

## Integration with Existing Test Suite

### Before Phase 9

- **Device Service Tests:** 17 tests (DevicesService only)
- **Total Backend Tests:** 247 tests
- **File Coverage:** 30.4% (41/135)

### After Phase 9

- **Device Service Tests:** 115 tests (+98 tests, +576%)
- **Total Backend Tests:** 345 tests (+98 tests)
- **File Coverage:** 33.3% (45/135) (+2.9 percentage points)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Mock Setup Order Matters:** Error path tests require careful mock setup to ensure errors propagate correctly through the call chain.

2. **Timer Utilities Are Essential:** Any service using `setTimeout` or `setInterval` needs `jest.useFakeTimers()` for fast, deterministic tests.

3. **Private Method Testing:** TypeScript allows `service["privateMethod"]()` syntax for testing private methods without exposing them.

4. **Prometheus Testing:** Text-based metric validation via `getMetrics()` is more reliable than trying to inspect internal counter values.

5. **Transaction Mocking:** Complex ORM operations (like TypeORM transactions) benefit from creating dedicated mock entity managers.
